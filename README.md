# Book Management Backend - BrewApp

This project is an assignment given by brewapp in which I have created some APIs using node, express, and mongodb.



## Tech Stack

**Server:** Node, Express

**Backend:** MongoDB

**Tools:** Docker, Git




## Deployment - Using Docker

Clone the project
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rishabhguptaxdev/brewapp-assignment
```

Change to directory
```sh
   cd brewapp-assignment
```

Rename .env.sample file to .env
```sh
   mv .env.sample .env
```

Build the image and run it

- It will create two containers

- One for MongoDB Database and other for Application

- Initially DB will connect to Application then Application will be started.

```sh
   docker-compose up --build
```
